INFO: [Common 17-1223] The version limit for your license is '2017.12' and will expire in -305 days. A version limit expiration means that, although you may be able to continue to use the current version of tools or IP with this license, you will not be eligible for any updates or new releases.
Running DRC as a precondition to command write_bitstream
INFO: [DRC 23-27] Running DRC with 8 threads
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PDRC-153) Gated clock check - Net clk_div0/CLK is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin clk_div0/Count[2]_i_2/O, cell clk_div0/Count[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PLHOLDVIO-2) Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations - A LUT clk_div0/Count[2]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 3 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    up1/Count_reg[0] {FDCE}
    up1/Count_reg[1] {FDCE}
    up1/Count_reg[2] {FDCE}

WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (ZPS7-1) PS7 block required - The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
INFO: [Vivado 12-3199] DRC finished with 0 Errors, 3 Warnings
INFO: [Vivado 12-3200] Please refer to the DRC report (report_drc) for more information.
