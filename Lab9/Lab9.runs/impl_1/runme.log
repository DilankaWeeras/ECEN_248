WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PDRC-153) Gated clock check - Net clk_div0/CLK is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin clk_div0/Count[2]_i_2/O, cell clk_div0/Count[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PLHOLDVIO-2) Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations - A LUT clk_div0/Count[2]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 3 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    up1/Count_reg[0] {FDCE}
    up1/Count_reg[1] {FDCE}
    up1/Count_reg[2] {FDCE}
